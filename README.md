# equipment_repository_template
all this fork thing is rubbish
This is a template repository. should be used as a guideline by people/groups developing equipment in this project
Unserious group admins, i forked you all.
Readme can have a link to all the relevant files/documents and can/should be used to give examples of data collected with the device as well as the rational behind its construction.
I forked this document.
Should also have mentions to code of conduct and contributing guidelines.
this is all too stressful, damn
